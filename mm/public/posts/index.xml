      <title>DNA punch card!</title>

      <description>DNA punch card.
A novel approach.
Always thought that other approaches like DNA fountain and Catalog DNA were not quite right. DNA Fountain code seemed to break down with different sets of data. Catalog DNA approach probably had difficulties scaling.
I still believe the encoding and decoding need to employ some machine learning. A combination of DNA punch card and clustering auto-encoder may get us closer.</description>

      <description>Bitcoin is difficult to grok. The best explanation may be this.
The Canadian Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX CEO who died with sole crypto keys making it impossible for customers to access bitcoins is a recent example of unregulated bitcoin interests. It&amp;rsquo;s also been reported that he got married and then filed a will 12 days before his death during his honeymoon trip in India. The wife is the sole beneficiary. Some people suspect he faked his death.</description>

      <description>Malcolm Gladwell wrote
about the 10,000 hour rule to achieve &amp;ldquo;greatness&amp;rdquo; in any given field requiring skills and expertise. Many dispute this and Anders Ericsson by citing quality vs. quantity of efforts and time. Tim Ferris and others claim that one can have world-class skills in 6 months or less by using creative feedback loop, deliberate practice, and other smarter ways of learning.
Peter Norvig blogged against some books with titles like Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours.</description>
