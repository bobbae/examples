Malcolm Gladwell [wrote](https://amzn.to/2Rtlney)   
about the 10,000 hour rule to achieve "greatness" in 
any given field requiring skills and expertise. 
Many dispute this and [Anders Ericsson](https://amzn.to/2XoX2KF)
 by citing quality vs. quantity of efforts and time.
  Tim Ferris and others claim that one can have world-class 
  skills in 6 months or less by using creative feedback loop,
   deliberate practice, and other smarter ways of learning.

  

Peter Norvig [blogged](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) 
against some books with titles
 like [Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours](https://amzn.to/2wszdGS). 
 Books like [SICP, a.k.a. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://amzn.to/2Xn3i5O) 
 takes time to read and comprehend. Each year I revisit the 
 book and learn something new. That is only a tiny part of 
 overall learning process and required readings. But we live in 
 the age of [Artificial Intelligence for Dummies](https://amzn.to/3e8nQF3), 
 which is a good book, by the way.

  

Nowadays, it is common to learn React and just enough 
javascript to be hired as a fullstack engineer creating PWA or 
SPA webapps in weeks or months. [Some](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/23/coding-academies-are-nonsense/) 
consider this nonsensical. [Others](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free) 
decry the hidden cost of coding bootcamp economics.
 [Many](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/bootcamps-wont-make-you-coder-heres-what-will-0) 
 still dispense their advice on this trend of code dojos.

There are [confessions](https://hackernoon.com/confessions-of-a-bootcamp-graduate-hack-reactor-f921c441fb23),
 [tell-alls](https://medium.com/@gbatra17/how-hack-reactor-remote-changed-my-life-the-one-year-later-review-and-what-people-dont-tell-1738ac053b42),
  and [conspiracy theories](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-Hackreactor-alumnis-LinkedIn-profiles-show-unemployed-status-as-opposed-to-the-98-hire-rate-advertisement-from-the-Hackreactor-website).

  
  

Perhaps we all need to slow down and read
 [The Humble Programmer](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html).
  Yes, it was written probably too long ago, i.e. before the Web! 
   But I think it is useful to read about this
    somewhat *new at the time* discipline of **Programming** as 
    presented by Professor Dijkstra at ACM Turing lecture, 1972.
