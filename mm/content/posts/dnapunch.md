[DNA punch card](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15588-z).

A novel approach.

Always thought that other approaches like
[DNA fountain](https://dnafountain.teamerlich.org/) 
and
[Catalog DNA](https://www.catalogdna.com/)
were not quite right.  DNA Fountain code seemed to break down
with different sets of data.  Catalog DNA approach probably
had difficulties scaling.

I still believe the encoding and decoding need to employ 
[some machine learning](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-41822-8_15.pdf).  A combination of DNA punch card and 
clustering auto-encoder may get us closer.
